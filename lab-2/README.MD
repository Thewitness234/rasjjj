#### Title:
*Implementation of Basic Sound Processing Techniques, Including Audio Synthesis and Manipulation*

#### Introduction:
This report explores the use of sound processing techniques using Python libraries including *Librosa* and *PyDub*. These libraries enable audio conversion, synthesis, visualization and analysis. The focus is on demonstrating the input, processing, analysis and production of audio signals.

#### Objectives:
- Load and play audio files.
- Processing and manipulation of audio signals.
- Display audio waveform and spectral properties.
- Creating audio signals from scratch.

#### Tools and Libraries:
- *Librosa*: For audio analysis and visualization.
- *PyDub*: For audio manipulation and synthesis.
- *Matplotlib*: For plotting waveforms and spectrograms.
- *Numpy*: For numerical operations.
- *Soundfile*: For saving synthesized audio.

##### 2. Manipulating Audio Files:
Both libraries were used for manipulating audio signals.

- *Speed Change (PyDub)*:
  
faster_audio = audio.speedup(playback_speed=1.5)
faster_audio.export("audio-clips/faster_sample.wav", format="wav")

- *Volume Adjustment (PyDub)*:
  
louder_audio = audio + 15
louder_audio.export("audio-clips/louder_sample.wav", format="wav")

- *Silence Removal (Librosa)*:
  
y_trimmed, _ = librosa.effects.trim(y, top_db=20)

##### 3. Visualizing Audio:
Visualization techniques include plotting raw waveforms and spectrograms.

- *Waveform Plot (Librosa)*:
  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
pd.Series(y).plot(figsize=(10, 5), lw=1, title='Raw Audio Example')

- *Spectrogram (Librosa)*:
  
import librosa.display
D = librosa.stft(y)
S_db = librosa.amplitude_to_db(np.abs(D), ref=np.max)
librosa.display.specshow(S_db, x_axis='time', y_axis='log')

##### 4. Synthesizing Audio from Scratch:
Using *Numpy* and *Soundfile*, we generated and saved a sine wave.

- *Sine Wave Generation*:
  
t = np.linspace(0, duration, int(sampling_rate * duration), endpoint=False)
sine_wave = 0.5 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * frequency * t)
sf.write("audio-clips/sine_wave.wav", sine_wave, sampling_rate)

- *Plotting the Sine Wave*:
  
plt.plot(t[:1000], sine_wave[:1000])

#### Results:
- Insert, play, and optimize audio files.
- Raw audio and spectral representation of visibility.
- Systematically generated audio signals.

#### conclusion:
The combination of *Librosa* and *PyDub* provides robust audio processing and conversion. These libraries facilitate complex functions such as spectral analysis, waveform editing, and synthesis. This research lays the foundation for more advanced audio applications, including speech recognition and music generation.

#### Future Scope:
- Application of machine learning techniques for audio segmentation.
- Look for advanced effects such as echo and filtering.
- Real-time audio signal processing.
